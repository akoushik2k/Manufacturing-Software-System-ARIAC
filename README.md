# Manufacturing Software System ARIAC

[Environment](environment.png)
---
## Introduction
This project contains motion planning & completing orders RWA 5, based on ARIAC (Agile Robotics for Industrial Automation Competition) v2023.5.0. 
The project is implemented in Python and C++ and focuses on retrieving kitting trays and parts for each order in the ARIAC environment.

MoveIt Order Fulfillment System with ROS

###Task 1-Order Processing:
 - Subscribing to the /ariac/orders topic to receive incoming orders.
 - Processing each order with the required actions to fulfill it.

###Task 2-Motion Planning:
 - Utilizing MoveIt to plan and execute robot motions like pick and place objects.
 - Based on the task requirements and robot capabilities we are deciding whether to perform motion planning in Joint space or in Cartesian space. 

###Task 3-Python-C++ Communication:
 - Since we are using a combination of both Pyhton and C++ we have implemented servers in C++ to encapsulate robot motion control methods.
 - And clients in Python to send requests to the C++ servers, enabling seamless communication between Python and C++ nodes.

###Task 4-Dynamic Planning Scene Update:
 - Ensure that objects added to the planning scene have unique names to prevent potential bugs.
 - Update objects' poses in the planning scene whenever their positions change to maintain accurate planning data.

###Task 5-Simulation Considerations:
 - Setting the parameter `use_sim_time` for any node that interacts with simulation.

## Usage
Downlaod the official setup from ARIAC for simulation and world setup [ARIAC GITHUB](https://github.com/usnistgov/ARIAC/tree/ariac2023)

[Note]: The code is written based on the ARIAC 2023 models so only download those


Make sure you have created a copy of ```rwa5_spring2024.yaml``` and placed it in the given location:
```
<your_ariac_workspace_directory>/src/ariac/ariac_gazebo/config/trials/
```

[Note]: Ensure that you have built and sourced ariac environment properly. If not, follow these steps:

1. ```cd <your_ariac_workspace>```
2. ```colcon build```
3. ```source install/setup.bash```

1. To run the ARIAC simulation, enter:
    ```
    ros2 launch ariac_gazebo ariac.launch.py trial_name:rwa5_spring2024
    ```

2. To launch the RWA5 Group1 submission, in a new terminal, run:
    ```
    ros2 launch final_group1 final_group1.launch.py
    ```

[Note]: Ensure that the new terminal has also sourced the final_group1 package. You can source it using:
